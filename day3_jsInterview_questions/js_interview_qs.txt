1.Give an example where call apply bind is. required?

The call() and apply() are very similar methods. They both execute the bound function on the object immediately. 
The bind() method does not execute the function right away. 
Instead, it creates and returns a bound function that can be executed later.

2.What is the difference between readFile and readFileSync?
readFileSync() is synchronous and blocks execution until finished. 
These return their results as return values. 
readFile() are asynchronous and return immediately while they function in the background.

3.What does process in node.js mean?
The process object in Node. js is a global object that can be accessed inside any module without requiring it. 
There are very few global objects or properties provided in Node. 
js and process is one of them. It is an essential component in the Node.

4.Explain what node.js is?
Node. js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications.
 Node. js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

 5.What is the difference of JS from browser to JS on node.js
 JavaScript is a simple programming language that runs in any browser JavaScript Engine. Whereas Node JS is an interpreter or running environment for a JavaScript programming language that holds many excesses, it requires libraries that can easily be accessed from JavaScript programming for better use.

6.Write three different ways to reverse a string in Javascript? 
a. using inbuilt method, 
b. iteratively, 
c. recursively

 // inbuild function
var str="masaischool";

function ReverseString(str) {
    return str.split('').reverse().join('')
 }

console.log(ReverseString(str))


// iteration method
var bag="";
for(var i=str.length-1;i>=0;i--){
bag=bag+str[i];
}
console.log(bag)

// recursion method
//  var n=str.length
 function reverse(str) {
    if(str.charAt(0) === ''){
      return "";
    }
    return str.charAt(str.length -1) + reverse(str.substring(0,str.length-1));
  }
console.log(reverse(str))

7.Write a program to check two objects are equal ( deep equal )?

var obj1={name:"ramesh",place:"vizag"};
var obj2={name:"ramesh",place:"vizag"}

function check(obj1,obj2){
    for(let key in obj1){

        if(obj1[key]!==obj2[key])
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}

console.log(check(obj1,obj2))


8.What is shallow equal?

A function for performing a shallow comparison between two objects or arrays. 
Two values have shallow equality when all of their members are strictly equal to the corresponding member of the other.
